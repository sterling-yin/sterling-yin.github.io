        **Xing Yin** is a postdoctoral fellow at Zhejiang University. He received his Ph.D. in Structural Engineering from *Zhejiang University*, and was awarded the fellowship of *China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents*. His research focuses on *the dynamic behavior of advanced engineering materials and structures under extreme loading conditions*. By exploring dynamic constitutive relations, capturing multi-scale structural responses, and examining failure mechanisms of fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs) subjected to impact, blast, and penetration, his work seeks to contribute to a better understanding of material performance and to support the development of composite structures with enhanced resilience.
