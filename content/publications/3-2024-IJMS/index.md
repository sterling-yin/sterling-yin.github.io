abstract: Strain-hardening cementitious composites (SHCC), composed of short fibres embedded within brittle matrix, exhibit distinctive pre-peak strain-hardening characteristics and remarkable tensile ductility. The fracture and failure process of SHCC, involving both hardening and softening stages as a result of matrix multiple micro-cracking and strain localization, is highly complex and poses a significant challenge for numerical modelling. In the present paper, a novel numerical framework, characterized by the bi-layer superposed cohesive zone strategy, is developed for the numerical modelling of fracture and multiple cracking of SHCC, at both the material scale and structural scale. The developed model is based on diffused cohesive interface model, but with adaptions to consider fibre bridging mechanism. The crack interface is simulated by two cohesive elements sharing the same nodes: one for the matrix-cohesion effect and the other for the fibre-bridging effect. Cohesive constitutive relations of matrix cohesion and fibre bridging are carefully assigned. The proposed model is first validated on the material scale through a uniaxial tension test. With the aid of a random material field, multiple-cracking phenomenon and stress fluctuation are successfully predicted by the model. The model is then applied to the structural fracture modelling, where four case studies, including both pure mode I and mixed mode fracture, are performed. The size effect and boundary effect on the fracture behaviour are well captured by the numerical modelling. The model proposed in the current work has the potential to be extended to the multiple cracking modelling of other materials.
