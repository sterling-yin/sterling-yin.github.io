abstract = {This study presents a two-phase mesoscale numerical model to investigate the dynamic spalling fracture behaviour of hybrid fibre ultra-high toughness cementitious composites (UHTCC). The model simulated the presence of random steel fibres and ductile UHTCC independently, and accurately incorporated the fibre-matrix bond-slip relationship, with carefully considering the influence of the inclination angle of the steel fibres on the pullout behaviour. Validation of the numerical model involved a meticulous comparison between numerical outcomes and results from spallation tests, encompassing strain-time and velocity-time histories, failure modes, and locations of cracking or fracture. Subsequently, the developed model was employed to analyse the impact of fibre inclination, stress wave amplitude, and waveform (based on the impulse equivalence principle) on the dynamic spalling fracture behaviour of hybrid fibre UHTCC. Evaluation of spalling fracture performance was based on both maximum velocity and pullback velocity of resulting fragments or free surfaces. Findings revealed that fibres parallel to the stress wave propagation direction exhibited optimum performance. It was also observed that stress waveforms with rectangular and sinusoidal shapes presented the highest risk of spalling fracture, while exponentially attenuated waves were comparatively safer. Additionally, stress waveforms with either rise time or duration at maximum pressure were deemed hazardous. Further, the hybrid fibre UHTCC demonstrated multiple spalling cracking/fracture behaviours under all stress waves except rectangular ones. This comprehensive exploration provided insights for the utilization of hybrid fibre UHTCC in impact engineering.},
