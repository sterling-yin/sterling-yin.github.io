abstract = {In this paper, the combined effect of fiber content and structural size on the fracture and post-cracking behaviour of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is investigated. The primary objective is to develop a model to link the macro-scale fracture response to these factors. To this end, comprehensive fracture tests of UHPC with various fiber contents and a wide size range were first conducted to examine the effect of fiber content and structural size on the mechanical parameters such as ductility, fracture energy and nominal flexural strength. Then, an integrated framework combining a micromechanics-informed fiber-bridging model and a cohesive fracture model was proposed for predicting the post-cracking behaviour of UHPC. The key focus is on incorporating the structural size-induced differences in realistic fiber distribution into the deviation of the stress-crack width relation. To facilitate practical application, a simplified two-stage stress–crack width law, supplemented with a micromechanics-informed rapid parameter determination method, was also suggested. Finally, a procedure for introducing size effect and the potential differences of fiber distribution into structural failure analysis was preliminarily proposed. This research gives further insights into the design and failure analysis of large UHPC structures, where the structural dimensions-induced discrepancies of fiber distribution must be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {The multi-cracking and strain-hardening capacities of Ultra-high Toughness Cementitious Composites (UHTCC) make it feasible for orthotropic steel bridge decks (OSBDs) applications to control crack width. In this composite bridge deck, shear connectors play an important role in providing good shear strength and ensuring structural service performance. To evaluate the shear resistance of short-headed studs embedded in ultra-thin UHTCC layer, three series of push-out tests were conducted in this study. The test results including shear strength, fatigue strength, failure modes, dynamic slip, stiffness degradation, plastic slip and residual mechanical properties were all considered and carefully discussed. In this study, the shear force of shear connectors was calculated and compared with current codes. The stress amplitude-fatigue life (S-N) relationship of studs was fitted by different codes. Then the empirical formulation was developed to predict the load-slip behavior and stiffness degradation of studs during fatigue loading. The relationship between plastic slip and fatigue life was established and normalized. Furthermore, based on post-fatigue static test results and test results in previous research, a new machine learning model was proposed to predict the residual shear strength of studs and contrasted with previous model. Then Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with two parameters (i.e. load amplitude, maximum repeated force) was conducted and revealed that the peak load significantly impacted the residual shear strength of push-out specimens compared with load amplitude. Moreover, a parametric study was conducted to further investigate the degradation of studs under various working conditions. By experimental and theoretical analysis, UHTCC could fully develop the shear strength of studs embedded in ultra-thin cover thickness. And related models were established to predict the static and fatigue behavior of steel-UHTCC push-out specimen.},

abstract = {In this study, the splitting tests were conducted to examine the effect of strain rate on the splitting tensile performance of high-strength ultrahigh-toughness cementitious composites (HS-UHTCCs). Hydraulic machine and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) were used to investigate the tensile properties of HS-UHTCCs. The strain rates ranged from 10−6 to 10−3 s−1 for hydraulic machine experiments and from 5 to 15 s−1 for SHPB tests, respectively. The splitting tensile strength, tensile stress-strain curves, dynamic increase factor (DIF) and energy absorption ability of HS-UHTCCs were analyzed. The new DIF models proposed for HS-UHTCCs fit well with the experimental data. In addition, the failure modes of specimens and fibers were investigated. The splitting tensile strain was obtained from digital image correlation (DIC) tests. The results indicate that the strain rate has a significant effect on the splitting tensile strength and energy absorption ability of HS-UHTCCs. On the contrary, the average splitting tensile strain showed a decreasing trend with the increase of strain rate. Besides, the DIF model of HS-UHTCCs was proposed with experimental data. The failure modes of specimens changed at high strain rates, transitioning from remaining intact to completely splitting into half. Two failure patterns of polyethylene (PE) fibers included pull-out failure and rupture were observed, while steel fibers experienced pull-out failure.},

abstract = {This study presents a two-phase mesoscale numerical model to investigate the dynamic spalling fracture behaviour of hybrid fibre ultra-high toughness cementitious composites (UHTCC). The model simulated the presence of random steel fibres and ductile UHTCC independently, and accurately incorporated the fibre-matrix bond-slip relationship, with carefully considering the influence of the inclination angle of the steel fibres on the pullout behaviour. Validation of the numerical model involved a meticulous comparison between numerical outcomes and results from spallation tests, encompassing strain-time and velocity-time histories, failure modes, and locations of cracking or fracture. Subsequently, the developed model was employed to analyse the impact of fibre inclination, stress wave amplitude, and waveform (based on the impulse equivalence principle) on the dynamic spalling fracture behaviour of hybrid fibre UHTCC. Evaluation of spalling fracture performance was based on both maximum velocity and pullback velocity of resulting fragments or free surfaces. Findings revealed that fibres parallel to the stress wave propagation direction exhibited optimum performance. It was also observed that stress waveforms with rectangular and sinusoidal shapes presented the highest risk of spalling fracture, while exponentially attenuated waves were comparatively safer. Additionally, stress waveforms with either rise time or duration at maximum pressure were deemed hazardous. Further, the hybrid fibre UHTCC demonstrated multiple spalling cracking/fracture behaviours under all stress waves except rectangular ones. This comprehensive exploration provided insights for the utilization of hybrid fibre UHTCC in impact engineering.},

And these damages could cause danger to the personnel and equipment. In this study, ultra-high toughness cementitious composite (UHTCC) with significant strain-hardening behavior (ultimate tensile strain >3%) was utilized to improve the blast resistance of construction structure. The UHTCC square slabs with a side length of 2000 mm were tested under contact explosions. The cratering and spalling damage of slabs were investigated. A total of six slabs (three RC slabs and three UHTCC slabs) under three different weight of TNT charge (2 kg, 4 kg, and 5 kg) were tested. The results showed the UHTCC slabs presented excellent blast resistance compared with RC slabs. The existing empirical predictions were employed to explore the damage mode of UHTCC slabs compared with the experimental results. The suitability and accuracy of the predictions were discussed. The structured and unstructured discretizations with different mesh size were used in the finite element (FE) model. The simulation results from the unstructured discretizations show better agreement with the experimental results than that from the structured discretizations. The effect of mesh size on the damaged area, damaged depth, deflection-time curves of the slab and the eroded volume fraction were compared and discussed. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of input parameters in the numerical model were conducted. the maximum failure strain, the compressive strength and the mass density of UHTCC were employed as the input parameters to investigate and discuss their effects on the value of output parameters, which include the damaged area, damaged depth and maximum deflection of UHTCC slab.},

Six UHTCC slabs and two ordinary concrete slabs with dimensions of 600 mm × 600 mm × 60 mm were subjected to blast loadings at scaled distances of 0.043 m/kg1/3, 0.085 m/kg1/3, 0.136 m/kg1/3, 0.271 m/kg1/3, 0.407 m/kg1/3 and 0.356 m/kg1/3 by varying both charge and distance to the slab. The results indicate the UHTCC displayed better blast resistance performance than the ordinary concrete. Under 200 g TNT blast loadings, the UHTCC slabs presented breaching damage and several cracks and could still bear the load, while the ordinary concrete slabs were broken severely and could not bear load anymore. The existing empirical formulae, including McVays' and UFC 3-340-02, were employed and discussed to predict the failure modes of UHTCC slabs under blast loading. And a formula was proposed to estimate the residual load-carrying capacity of UHTCC slabs and was fitted well with the experimental data. Furthermore, Finite Element (FE) models were developed to study the dynamic response of slabs in LS-DYNA. The findings of this study indicate that the UHTCC has good potential for the constitution of protective structures.},

Residual velocities of the projectiles were determined by a high speed camera. The test results showed 46 MPa UHTCC has superior resistance to the tensile damage induced cratering and scabbing while its penetration resistance is comparable to NC with a lower compressive strength (30 MPa). The 123 MPa RPC exhibits much higher penetration resistance than UHTCC and NC, and has improved performance over NC in resisting tensile damage. Besides, based on the framework of the Forrestal formula, a unified semi-analytical model is proposed which can predict the penetration and perforation ballistic parameters of thick concrete panel under projectile impact. Compared to the experimental observations, the proposed model predicts the residual velocity and penetration depth of this test with better results than existing models. Finally, the new model is applied to the available perforation tests of thick concrete panels, and its error used for relatively thin concrete panel is analyzed.},

abstract = {This study used unnotched compression tests and digital image correlation technology to analyze the influence of two different casting intervals and three different roughness conditions on the fracture toughness of the interfaces between ultra-high toughness cementitious composite (UHTCC) and reactive powder concrete (RPC). UHTCC exhibits pseudo-strain-hardening responses and multi-cracking behaviors, and the most notable characteristic of RPC is its dense microstructure. The results show that the complete interfacial shear fracture process included three stages: crack initiation, steady crack propagation and unsteady crack propagation. A double-K crack propagation criterion for interfacial shear fracture of composite structures was proposed by introducing two parameters: initial and unstable fracture toughness. After introducing interfacial roughness via the scratch method, the unstable fracture toughness decreased. The 24-h casting interval group had a lower initial fracture toughness and higher unstable fracture toughness than the 2-h group. The unstable fracture toughness of all the composite specimens exceeded that of C60 concrete, indicating that they had excellent resistance to interfacial shear fracture.},
